I tried to carry over the structure I've used in R projects but Python modules work a bit differently than R. This makes it awkward when trying to store cached versions of loaded data and only loading data when it is required.

In addition, a pure data analysis script has different needs than a visualization application. And this particular project is dealing very small datasets where data object management is really unnecessary.

Still working to find a DRY approach that feels right.
